I managed to build my first Flutter App and the UI inspiration is from Dribble by awesome artist [Pavel] (https://dribbble.com/shots/4198066-Dailyui-Weather-App)
As I am a beginner , I know I did not use good codes , did not refactor well but am in the process of learning .

If you can contribute in any way please Do So , I'm adding more and more functionality to the App.

- [✔] : Managed to detect Cities Automatically according to the co-ordinates.
- [✔] : Successfully implemented DarkSky Weather API.
- [✔] : Added Summary , Min and Max Temperature.


### Todos
-For now the icon is static , I'm working on changing the icons according to the changes in the weather .

-Add more and more Functionality to test my skills and improve it.
