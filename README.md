![Screenshot of the App](screenshot1.jpg?raw=true "ScreenShot"width="350"height="500")
I managed to build my first Flutter App and the UI inspiration is from Dribble by awesome artist [Pavel] (https://dribbble.com/shots/4198066-Dailyui-Weather-App)
As I am a beginner , I know I did not use good codes , did not refactor well but am in the process of learning .

If you can contribute in any way please Do So , I'm adding more and more functionality to the App.

[✔] : Managed to detect Cities Automatically according to the co-ordinates.
[✔] : Successfully implemented DarkSky Weather API.


TODO :
    1.For now the icon is static , I'm working on changing the icons according to the changes in the weather .
    2.Adding Summary of the Weather Condition .
    3.Right Now , I couldnt figure a way to get current Temperature for the weekdays , hence am making new UI changer for tempMax and tempMin.
    4.Add more and more Functionality to test my skills and improve it.
